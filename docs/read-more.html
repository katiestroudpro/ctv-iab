                    <p>The key to good ad experiences is being able to deliver the most relevant ads to the right people. The challenge of course is that this has to be done with end-user privacy in mind. While the “cookie-apocalypse” has been a major point of discussion in our industry, the CTV world does not run on cookies, and so has not been a subject of that news much so far.
In the meantime, Tech Lab’s CTV/OTT IFA guidelines (released in December 2018) provide a privacy-compliant identity mechanism for CTV platforms and publishers to employ today. The guidelines consist of 3 components- recommendations on the structure of the ID itself, a "limit ad tracking" flag, and a IFA type to help provide more insights into the IFA being passed. The adoption of these guidelines seems to be picking up in recent months. We also have some discussions ongoing in the working group around improving the guidelines (for example removing the platform specific "types", providing transparency around length of time a session id might last, etc) based on learnings in the industry over the last 2 years. So stay tuned for more here!
That said, privacy is likely the most important driver in ad tech's direction these days, and everyone should pay attention to the conversations happening in Project Rearc. There are near-term implications to the vanishing cookies in relation to “cross-platform device graphs” which are important to understand and work through. The recent IDFA announcement from Apple with iOS14 might also have an impact on the use of IFAs longer term, but it is still early days on that front, and the industry is working through the mobile implications before we get to the CTV implications. Please join the Programmatic WG if you are interested in the IDFA/SkAdNetworks conversation.
Finally, content/context-based advertising will also likely be a big part of the privacy-safe future. This means that the Content Taxonomy and Audience taxonomy are going to be important for targeting and other aspects of addressability. The CTV & Video Working Group is currently working on updating the Content Taxonomy to better support the CTV world. We are including more relevant movie/TV genres and video related categories, and putting together best practices on the usage of the categories and other vectors that the 2.x content taxonomy supports. Please join the CTV WG if you are interested in contributing to this conversation.
